Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\nSource: 0-pl\nContent: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\nSource: 24-pl\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\nSource: 5-pl\nContent: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.\nSource: 34-pl\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\nSOURCES:\n\nQUESTION: Do you have snacks at office\n=========\nContent: ---\n\n**Snacks and more**\n\nThere will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. \n\nOn any other regular day:\n\n- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.\n- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.\n- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.\n\nIf you are a big snack lover or don\'t want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.\n\n---\n\n**Clean up your shit**\n\nYou need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don\'t forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This \'system\' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.\n\nFahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets. \n\n---\n\n**Think about the environment.**\n\nKill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don\'t waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don\'t waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.\n\n# Work at Blendle\n\n---\n\nIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our [job ads here](https://blendle.homerun.co/). \n\n[Package Delivery](Office%20d0ebcaaa2074442ba155c67a41d315dd/Package%20Delivery%20ebe31702ef51431b8b33b067b43f464e.md)\nSource: Notion_DB/Blendle\'s Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3/Office d0ebcaaa2074442ba155c67a41d315dd.md\n\nContent: # Office\n\n# Our office and everything in it\n\n**Workplace:** \n\nWe have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it\'s handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.\n\n---\n\n**The headphone rule:** \n\nWe don\'t like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can\'t. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!\n\n---\n\n**Lunch**\n\n~12 o\' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Joëlle is in charge of lunch —\xa0ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).\n\nWhat you can expect from lunch:\n\n- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!\n- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.\n- Variety: Variation is good. But it\'s also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.\n- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.\n\n---\n\n**Snacks and more**\nSource: Notion_DB/Blendle\'s Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3/Office d0ebcaaa2074442ba155c67a41d315dd.md\n\nContent: **Headspace**\n\nTo keep your head in shape, we pay for the best apps to help you do so: Headspace to stay calm and mindful and **Things** to boost your productivity and help you reach your goals.

Buurtboer arranges nice lunches including sandwiches (to be self-made), salad, eggs and veggies. Just get your plate, walk to the salad bar (yes we got a salad bar from Marktplaats for 100 euros), grab whatever you like and enjoy the company of your colleagues (or don’t, whatever). Any allergies or preferences? Let us know at [officemanagement@blendle.com](mailto:officemanagement@blendle.com).\n\nDon’t be afraid to help out on cleaning up after lunch.

No, we care for each other so we will feel sorry for you. And everyone is willing to help out if you get in a tough spot being ill at home. To get the needed help or rest, just let your team lead know you’re staying at home (or going home).\n\n**Official Holidays and Vacay!**\nSource: Notion_DB/Blendle\'s Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3/YOUR first week x 940621ae57e54c39aa5ded6e1b49cf4d.md\n\nContent: **Food and exercise**\n    \n    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn’t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn’t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.\n    \n    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**\n    \n    Don’t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It’s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.\n    \n- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**\n    \n    \n    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones\n    2. Blendle\n    \n    It’s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it’s not, it will add to your stress level.\nSource: Notion_DB/Blendle\'s Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3/Diversity and Inclusion b8d3907631944696a4e76c2a41e757a5/#letstalkaboutstress 26c5eee20f854bb9ac6921f35c9a50b3/What can I do de9fe4bbfc404540a042985ed4e7f85b.md\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER:'
